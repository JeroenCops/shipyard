### Build

This demo uses a JS packet manager to build and run.\
You can use the one you prefer, I'll use `npm`.\
All commands are made inside the `bunny_demo` directory.

Before any other command (only needed once):

```shell
npm install
```

Starts the demo in watch mode.\
Changing files in `bunny_demo` will cause a re-compile and reload of the page.\
It runs slower but is faster to build.

```shell
npm start
```

Build the demo in release mode, all files will be in the `public` directory.\
I'm using [`microserver`](https://crates.io/crates/microserver) to make the server.

```shell
npm run build
microserver public
```

The demo is now accessible at `http://localhost:9090/` (the port might be different if you are using a different tool to make the server).
